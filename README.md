**GOAL OF THE PROJECT**

The goal of the project was to create an interactive PowerBI dashboard to display the individual player ratings for a group of friends who play football together. The dashboard was made to be interactive to allow people to view the stats of different players. This helps them realize where their performance metrics are in comparison with other players. This information can be used to identify areas of strength, where improvement is needed as well as optimum positions on the pitch.


**THE DATA**

•	The dataset was derived by administering a questionnaire using Google Forms to collect individual player data. 

•	It was then saved into Microsoft Excel for easy manipulation.

•	The data includes bio data of players, ratings across different metrics, details on which players are considered the best in the group. 

**QUESTIONS**

•	What do players rate themselves for pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending and physicality?

•	What is the most popular football boot brand amongst players?

•	Who do players consider the best at certain positions and the overall best player?


**ANALYSIS PROCESS**

Excel

1.	Copied the original sheet to use as a working sheet to keep the original data safe. 
2.	Removed duplicates from the dataset.
3.	Cleaned the data by standardizing player names through the data.
4.	Standardized height column to feet and inches
5.	Split the data into multiple sheets to ensure ease of analysis.
6.	 Used the average function to generate the average ratings for individuals.

PowerBI

1.	Created a bar chart to present the individual ratings for abilities.
2.	Created a special card graphic based on FIFA Ultimate Team cards to display individual player average ratings. (This was done to present users with a sense of familiarity).
3.	Downloaded and used a 5-star visual to present the skill move ratings.
4.	Created a slicer to help filter the attribute chart by individual player.
